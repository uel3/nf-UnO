To test all processes in the pipeline, we provide subsets of test metagenomic sequencing reads from a Salmonella outbreak. These subsets are derived from the following SRA accessions:

SRR5058928 
SRR5058922 
SRR5058919
SRR5058921
SRR5058923

The test datasets were generated by randomly sampling 100,000 paired-end reads from each original SRA dataset using seqtk. This approach ensures adequate pipeline testing while minimizing computational resource requirements. More information about this dataset can be found here: (https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02577-16)
